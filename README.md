# GitOps Validation (gov)

This document contains the requirements to generate a PRD for the GitOps Validation (gov) application

- I wrote this file
  - It only took a few minutes as I could use a "stream of conciousness" approach instead of trying to organize
- `tasks/create-prd.mdc` is reused and contains the rules for generating a PRD
- `tasks/prd-gov.md` was generated by GitHub Agent Mode using GPT4.1

## Code

The Go code has been generated from the PRD - it hasn't been tested yet
