# Create a new Go app from this repo

If the Name of the new application is not specified in the prompt, ask for the Name
if the Namespace isn't specified, ask for the Namespace
If the working directory is not specified in the prompt, ask for the directory
If the docker repository (like ghcr.io/k8s-labs/{Name}) isn't specified, ask for the repository
the default version is 0.0.1 and should be used in the docker image tag - i.e. {Name}:0.0.1

Make sure you prompt the user for all needed information before continuing.

Using the bartr branch of this repo - https://github.com/k8s-labs/GitOpsValidation

Create a new Go application called {Name} from the "gov" Go Application in the repo

Make sure to include the go.mod file and rename the module to {Name} and the cmd/gov to cmd/{Name}

Make sure to include all files and directories under cmd and internal

Update the dockerfile with the new {Name}

Update the deploy directory to use the specified docker registry, {Name}, and {Namespace} - make sure to check every YAML file

Generate the files in the {Directory} specified in the prompt

After generating the files, run go mod tidy, make sure go build works, and make sure all tests pass.

Run docker build with the tag (-t) of the docker registry/name:version - example - ghcr.io/k8s-labs/validate:0.0.1

Search the entire workspace for all YAML files and update every instance of the namespace
Update all references to the application name and Docker image as needed.
After making changes, provide a summary of all files updated and confirm that every YAML file is consistent.
Do not stop after the first changeâ€”verify and update every relevant file.
At the end, output a checklist showing each requirement and whether it was completed.
